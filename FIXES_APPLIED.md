# Fixes Applied

## 1. ✅ Merged Admin Setup with Children Dashboard

**Problem**: Admin setup and children management were on separate pages.

**Solution**: 
- Renamed `children.js` to `AdminDashboard`
- Merged family creation functionality into the children admin page
- Added collapsible family setup section
- Fixed profile picture upload to use correct storage bucket (`album_uploads` instead of `photos`)

**Files Modified**:
- `pages/admin/children.js` - Now contains both family setup and children management

## 2. ✅ Fixed Upload Modal Scrolling

**Problem**: Upload modal content was scrollable, user wanted everything to fit in modal.

**Solution**:
- Reduced modal max height from `85vh` to `80vh`
- Added `overflow: hidden` to modal container
- Set specific max height for scrollable content area: `calc(80vh - 140px)`
- Reduced margins throughout the form (from 20px to 16px)
- Compressed spacing in children selection and error messages
- Reduced footer padding and set minimum height

**Files Modified**:
- `components/UploadForm.js` - Improved modal layout and spacing

## 3. ✅ Fixed Profile Picture Upload Error

**Problem**: Profile picture upload was failing with storage bucket errors.

**Root Cause**: Original code was trying to upload to `photos` bucket, but the correct bucket is `album_uploads`.

**Solution**:
- Changed storage bucket from `photos` to `album_uploads` in the upload function
- Added proper error handling to continue album creation even if profile picture upload fails
- Fixed the bucket reference in the merged admin dashboard

**Files Modified**:
- `pages/admin/children.js` - Fixed storage bucket reference

---

## 4. ✅ Code Quality Improvements

**Problem**: TypeScript diagnostics showing unused variables.

**Solution**:
- Removed unused `data` variables in Supabase queries where only error was needed
- Cleaned up unused imports and variables

**Files Modified**:
- `pages/admin/children.js` - Removed unused variables

4. ✅ **Code cleaned up** - Removed diagnostic warnings
